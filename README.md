Histopathological images are essential for medical diagnosis and treatment planning, but interpreting them accurately using machine learning can be challenging due to variations in tissue preparation, staining and imaging protocols. Domain generalization aims to address such limitations by enabling the learning models to generalize to new datasets or populations. Style transfer-based data augmentation is an emerging technique that can be used to improve the generalizability of machine learning models for histopathological images. However, existing style transfer-based methods can be computationally expensive, and they rely on artistic styles, which may negatively impact model accuracy. In this study, we propose a feature domain style mixing technique that uses adaptive instance normalization to estimate style-mixed versions of image features. We compare our proposed method with existing style transfer-based data augmentation methods and found that it performs similarly or better, despite requiring lower computation. Our results demonstrate the potential of feature domain statistics mixing in the generalization of learning models for histopathological image analysis.
